Monitoring Spartina Alterniflora removal dynamics across coastal China using time series Sentinel-1 imagery

You can run demo.py to visualize the output of the TSSCD model. The trained model is saved under the model_data folder. Please note that this model parameters is only valid in the research area specified in the paper, and its generalization performance has not been evaluated.
