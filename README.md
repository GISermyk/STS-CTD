Monitoring Spartina Alterniflora removal dynamics across coastal China using time series Sentinel-1 imagery

You can run output_demo.py to visualize the output of the STS-CTD model. The trained model is saved under the model_data folder. Please note that this model parameters is only valid in the research area specified in the paper.
